# FT learn
This repository stores some code and note I wrote during my learning process of Fourier Transform
## Why learn Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform (FT) constitutes a sophisticated mathematical technique that facilitates the conversion of time-domain signals into their frequency-domain representations. In the context of our project, which necessitates the analysis of vibration phenomena, the signals in question are inherently complex, encompassing a multitude of frequencies. Among these, certain spectral components are predominant, exerting a significant influence on the overall signal characteristics, while others contribute less prominently. Our objective is to employ the FT to decompose the composite signals into their discrete frequency constituents, thereby enabling us to concentrate our investigative efforts on the most influential spectral bands.
